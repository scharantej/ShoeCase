## Flask Application Design for a Shoe Promotion Website

### HTML Files

- **index.html (Homepage)**: This file will serve as the landing page of the website and will feature the main promotion for the brand's shoes. It will contain:
    - A hero section with an image of the featured shoe and a catchy headline.
    - A brief description of the shoe, highlighting its key features and benefits.
    - A call-to-action button that redirects users to a dedicated product page or a purchase page.

### Routes

- **`/home` (GET)**: This route will be responsible for rendering the index.html file, which displays the homepage of the promotion website.

## Additional Features and Considerations

- The application can integrate social media sharing buttons to allow users to easily share the promotion with friends and followers.
- To enhance user engagement, the website can include a live chat feature that enables real-time communication with a customer support representative.
- Analytics tools can be integrated to track website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates to help optimize the promotion's effectiveness.
- The design can be customized with the brand's colors, fonts, and imagery to maintain consistency and reinforce the brand's identity throughout the promotion.
